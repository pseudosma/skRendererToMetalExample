# SKRenderer to Metal Example

Incomplete project for testing rendering the output of SpriteKit to an MTKView. Some of the "useful" code has been lost, though, so don't look at this as a good working example yet.

The name is a misnomer; there was originally a companion project to this that tested writing SpriteKit content directly to an SKRenderer.
